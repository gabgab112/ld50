To make use of the PostFX included with this package, install the Post Processing package from the package manager. For HDR rendering, make sure to set the color space to linear in the player settings.

To change colors in the scenes in the built-in RP, change the colors of the ambient lighting of the scene. The ground color is mapped to the foreground, the sky color is mapped to the background, and the equator color is a global "tint" applyed to all objects. In URP, change the respective colors in the material tab.
